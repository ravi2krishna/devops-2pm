    -> Merge Conflicts 

        -> A Merge Conflict happens when two branches have been modified 
            with the changes and are subsequently merged.

        -> Git doesn’t know which changes to keep, and thus needs 
            human intervention(Manager) to resolve the conflict.

        -> When Automatic merge fails, we need to do Manual Merges

  Rebase & Merge

    -> Merge 

        -> Maintains a clear history of how branches have diverged 
        and converged. Easier to understand the history of the project.

    -> Rebase 

        ->  Creates a cleaner, linear project history.

    -> Applications will have an architecture 

    -> Three Tier Application Architecture is quite popular 
    for building web Applications 

    -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages_used_in_most_popular_websites

    -> Their development typically involves server-side coding, 
        client-side coding and database technology.

    -> Our Application Goes with following technologies 

        -> Frontend : React 

        -> Backend : Node 

        -> Database : Postgres 

    -> Application Flow 

        -> User -> Frontend -> Backend -> Database 

    -> Software Builds 

        -> The term Build refers to a process by which 
            source code is converted into binary code

                -> Binary Code == Software Artifact 

    -> Any Build You Want To Perform Requires Below Entities 

        -> Developer Starts Writing Source Code 

            -> Source Code is Human Readable Instructions 
            -> Source Code is updated in GitHub (Repos)

        -> Developer Starts Writing Metadata Files 

            -> Metadata refers to Data about data 
            
            -> Metadata is information about the project 

                -> Project Name 
                -> Project Version 
                -> Project Dependencies 
                -> Project Test Suite 
                -> etc 

        -> NOTE: Source Code & Metadata is always part of repository 

    
    -> Build Artifacts will be produced after build is done 

        -> Build process is handled by Developer in Laptops 

        -> Build process is handled by DevOps Engineer in Server

        -> Domain Name Mapping 

        -> SSL Certificate Generation

            -> https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=snap

        -> In Web Server i.e Nginx

            -> sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default 

                -> Update

            -> sudo nginx -t

            -> sudo systemctl restart nginx 

        -> To Generate FREE SSL visit below

            -> https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=snap

            -> sudo snap install --classic certbot

    -> DevOps is a set of PRACTICES that works towards the 
        AUTOMATION and INTEGRATION of the processes between 
        Software Development (Dev) and IT (Ops) teams, 
        so that organizations can BUILD, TEST, and DEPLOY softwares/applications 
        FASTER and more RELIABLE

    -> Docker == FASTER


    -> Whole LMS Application deployment took 1 Hour ( Azure Ubuntu VM ) - Diff setup

    -> Whole LMS Application deployment took 1 Hour ( Azure Redhat VM ) - Diff setup

    -> Whole LMS Application deployment took 1 Hour ( Azure SUSE VM ) - Diff setup


    -> LMS App Setup, i want this to be universal, thats what docker does 

    -> Docker Helps Build Portable Environments (1 Hour) -> 2 mins 

    -> Whole LMS Application deployment took 1 Hour ( Azure Ubuntu VM ) - Diff setup

    -> Now Using Docker Next Time Onwards, My deployment takes hardly 5 mins 


    -> Containerization 

        -> Containerization is one of the practices in devops, which provides 

            -> Lightweight and efficient way of running applications 
            
            -> Promotes faster deployments and portability for applications

        -> Applications will be 

            -> Monolithic Architecture

                -> Monolith means Large Stone 

                -> Monolithic Architecture is software design pattern, where the entire
                    application is built as single & indivisible unit 

            -> Microservices Architecture

                -> Microservices Architecture is a software development approach that involves 
                building small, independent services that work together 
                to create a larger application.

            -> Before Containerization we got on-prem or cloud(virtualization)

            -> If Applications are small / micro, why do you need 
                heavy weight VM's ?? 

                -> Answer for above problem is Containerization

    -> Docker Architecture / Components 

        -> Docker CLI
        -> Docker Daemon 
        -> Docker Registry (ACR / ECR / etc)
        -> Docker Images
        -> Docker Container

=============

    -> Docker Setup 

        -> In Azure B2S is the size to select. 

        -> Add Following Rules in Network Security Groups 

            -> 22, 80, 443
            -> 32768 - 61000 (docker pre defined range of ephemeral ports)
            -> 8080 - 9090 (user defined range of ephemeral ports)

            1  docker
            2  docker info
            3  sudo apt -V -s install docker.io
            4  ls
            5  curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o install-docker.sh
            6  ls
            7  chmod u+x install-docker.sh
            8  ./install-docker.sh
            9  docker info
            10  sudo docker info
            11  docker image ls
            12  docker container ls
            13  sudo grep docker /etc/group
            14  sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
            15  sudo grep docker /etc/group

            -> logout and re-login for changes to reflect 

        
    -> To Create Container We need Docker Images 

        -> Docker Images are present in Docker Registry 

            -> Docker Registry is hub.docker.com 
    
    -> Create Container 

        -> docker container run --name name_container <image> 

        -> docker container run --name c1 hello-world 

    -> Container Modes 

        -> Interactive Mode (debugging / testing mode)

            -> Interactive Mode: Containers run in the foreground, and their output is printed to the terminal.
                This mode is useful for debugging and development. Another name is Foreground Mode. 

                -> option is -it

        -> Detached Mode (production mode)

            -> Detached Mode: Containers run in the background, and their output is not printed to the terminal. 
                This mode is commonly used in production environments. Another name is Background Mode. 

                -> option is -dt
        

        -> Foreground Mode
            Create Ubuntu container in Foreground Mode:
            # Go with Two Sessions 
            docker container run --help
            docker container run -it --name c1 ubuntu:22.04


        -> Detached Mode
            Create Ubuntu container in Detached Mode:
            docker container run -dt --name c2 ubuntu:22.04

        -> Docker exec

            docker container run -dt --name c2 ubuntu:22.04
            docker container exec c2 uname
            docker container exec c2 ps -ef
            docker container exec c2 git
            docker container exec c2 ss
            docker container exec c2 ssh

            docker container stop CONTAINER_NAME
            docker container rm CONTAINER_NAME
            docker container start CONTAINER_NAME
            docker container rm -f CONTAINER_NAME

    -> Setup Web Server Container - 1

        docker container run -dt --name web ubuntu:22.04
        docker container exec -it web bash

        # Install ss command  
        ss -ntpl
        apt update -y
        apt install iproute2 -y
        ss -ntpl
        ps -ef


        # Update and Install Nginx
        apt install nginx -y

        # Start the Nginx service
        service nginx start
        ss -ntpl
        ps -ef

        # Access Nginx Web Server
        apt install curl -y
        curl localhost

    -> docker container inspect <container-name>

    -> docker stats
