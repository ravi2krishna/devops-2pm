    -> Merge Conflicts 

        -> A Merge Conflict happens when two branches have been modified 
            with the changes and are subsequently merged.

        -> Git doesn’t know which changes to keep, and thus needs 
            human intervention(Manager) to resolve the conflict.

        -> When Automatic merge fails, we need to do Manual Merges

  Rebase & Merge

    -> Merge 

        -> Maintains a clear history of how branches have diverged 
        and converged. Easier to understand the history of the project.

    -> Rebase 

        ->  Creates a cleaner, linear project history.

    -> Applications will have an architecture 

    -> Three Tier Application Architecture is quite popular 
    for building web Applications 

    -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages_used_in_most_popular_websites

    -> Their development typically involves server-side coding, 
        client-side coding and database technology.

    -> Our Application Goes with following technologies 

        -> Frontend : React 

        -> Backend : Node 

        -> Database : Postgres 

    -> Application Flow 

        -> User -> Frontend -> Backend -> Database 

    -> Software Builds 

        -> The term Build refers to a process by which 
            source code is converted into binary code

                -> Binary Code == Software Artifact 

    -> Any Build You Want To Perform Requires Below Entities 

        -> Developer Starts Writing Source Code 

            -> Source Code is Human Readable Instructions 
            -> Source Code is updated in GitHub (Repos)

        -> Developer Starts Writing Metadata Files 

            -> Metadata refers to Data about data 
            
            -> Metadata is information about the project 

                -> Project Name 
                -> Project Version 
                -> Project Dependencies 
                -> Project Test Suite 
                -> etc 

        -> NOTE: Source Code & Metadata is always part of repository 

    
    -> Build Artifacts will be produced after build is done 

        -> Build process is handled by Developer in Laptops 

        -> Build process is handled by DevOps Engineer in Server

    -> DevOps is a set of PRACTICES that works towards the 
        AUTOMATION and INTEGRATION of the processes between 
        Software Development (Dev) and IT (Ops) teams, 
        so that organizations can BUILD, TEST, and DEPLOY softwares/applications 
        FASTER and more RELIABLE

    -> Docker == FASTER


    -> Whole LMS Application deployment took 1 Hour ( Azure Ubuntu VM ) - Diff setup

    -> Whole LMS Application deployment took 1 Hour ( Azure Redhat VM ) - Diff setup

    -> Whole LMS Application deployment took 1 Hour ( Azure SUSE VM ) - Diff setup


    -> LMS App Setup, i want this to be universal, thats what docker does 

    -> Docker Helps Build Portable Environments (1 Hour) -> 2 mins 

    -> Whole LMS Application deployment took 1 Hour ( Azure Ubuntu VM ) - Diff setup

    -> Now Using Docker Next Time Onwards, My deployment takes hardly 5 mins 


    -> Containerization 

        -> Containerization is one of the practices in devops, which provides 

            -> Lightweight and efficient way of running applications 
            
            -> Promotes faster deployments and portability for applications

        -> Applications will be 

            -> Monolithic Architecture

                -> Monolith means Large Stone 

                -> Monolithic Architecture is software design pattern, where the entire
                    application is built as single & indivisible unit 

            -> Microservices Architecture

                -> Microservices Architecture is a software development approach that involves 
                building small, independent services that work together 
                to create a larger application.

            -> Before Containerization we got on-prem or cloud(virtualization)

            -> If Applications are small / micro, why do you need 
                heavy weight VM's ?? 

                -> Answer for above problem is Containerization

    -> Docker Architecture / Components 

        -> Docker CLI
        -> Docker Daemon 
        -> Docker Registry (ACR / ECR / etc)
        -> Docker Images
        -> Docker Container

            -> 8080 - 9090 (user defined range of ephemeral ports)

            1  docker
            2  docker info
            3  sudo apt -V -s install docker.io

            15  sudo grep docker /etc/group

            -> logout and re-login for changes to reflect 

        
    -> To Create Container We need Docker Images 

        -> Docker Images are present in Docker Registry 

            -> Docker Registry is hub.docker.com 
    
    -> Create Container 

        -> docker container run --name name_container <image> 

        -> docker container run --name c1 hello-world 

    -> Container Modes 

        -> Interactive Mode (debugging / testing mode)

            -> Interactive Mode: Containers run in the foreground, and their output is printed to the terminal.
                This mode is useful for debugging and development. Another name is Foreground Mode. 

                -> option is -it

        -> Detached Mode (production mode)

            -> Detached Mode: Containers run in the background, and their output is not printed to the terminal. 
                This mode is commonly used in production environments. Another name is Background Mode. 

                -> option is -dt
        

        -> Foreground Mode
            Create Ubuntu container in Foreground Mode:
            # Go with Two Sessions 
            docker container run --help
            docker container run -it --name c1 ubuntu:22.04


        -> Detached Mode
            Create Ubuntu container in Detached Mode:
            docker container run -dt --name c2 ubuntu:22.04

        -> Docker exec

            docker container run -dt --name c2 ubuntu:22.04
            docker container exec c2 uname
            docker container exec c2 ps -ef
            docker container exec c2 git
            docker container exec c2 ss
            docker container exec c2 ssh

            docker container stop CONTAINER_NAME
            docker container rm CONTAINER_NAME
            docker container start CONTAINER_NAME
            docker container rm -f CONTAINER_NAME

    -> Setup Web Server Container - 1

        docker container run -dt --name web ubuntu:22.04
        docker container exec -it web bash

        # Install ss command  
        ss -ntpl
        apt update -y
        apt install iproute2 -y
        ss -ntpl
        ps -ef


        # Update and Install Nginx
        apt install nginx -y

        # Start the Nginx service
        service nginx start
        ss -ntpl
        ps -ef

        # Access Nginx Web Server
        apt install curl -y
        curl localhost

    -> docker container inspect <container-name>

    -> docker stats
    

5th Dec 2025
=============

    -> Containers are non-persistent 

    -> Say we removed c1 from last class 

    -> Now again we need to start from step - 1

        -> again install nginx      
        -> again start nginx 

    
    -> Setup Web Server Container - 2

        -> While working with docker 

            -> Don't re-invent wheel again 

        -> docker container run -dt --name c2 nginx

        -> Trying to access container outside the host will not work

    
    -> Docker Networking 

        -> Docker networking enables communication

            -> between containers and the external network

            -> between containers and the host 

            -> in between containers also 


    -> Network Drivers
        
        -> Docker supports various network drivers, each designed for specific use case
            
            -> Bridge
            -> Host
            -> None

        -> Host: This driver removes network isolation between 
            the container and the Docker host, 
            allowing them to share the host’s networking namespace.

            -> docker network ls
            
            -> NOTE: By default all containers are created in Bridge network

            -> docker network inspect bridge

            -> docker network inspect host 

                -> no containers in host network

            -> Let's create container in host network Now

                -> docker container run -dt --name c3 --network=host nginx

                -> docker container ls -a

                -> docker network inspect host 

                -> docker container inspect c3

                    -> no ip for container c3, as it share network with host 

                    -> curl localhost

                    -> curl private-ip 

                    -> browse public-ip 

        -> NOTE: Challenge with host network is only one port can be used by one app 

            -> docker container run -dt --name c4 --network=host nginx

                -> Exited

            -> docker container run -dt --name c5 --network=host nginx

                -> Exited - 80 failed (98: Address already in use)

                -> docker container logs c4

    
    -> None Network

        -> This mode will not configure any IP for the container and 
            doesn’t have any access to the external network 
            as well as for other containers. 
            It does have the loopback address and can be used for running batch jobs.

           -> docker container exec c3 apt update -y (host network)

           -> docker container exec c1 apt update -y (bridge network)

           -> docker container run -dt --name c6 --network=none nginx

           -> docker container ls -a

           -> docker container inspect c6

           -> docker container exec c6 apt update -y (none network)

    -> Bridge Network

        -> The default bridge network in Docker is a pre-defined network named bridge,
         which is automatically created when you install Docker. 
         It is the default network for containers if no other network is specified.

        -> When you start a container without specifying a network, 
            it connects to the bridge network by default.

        -> Containers on the bridge network can communicate with each other using IP addresses 

            -> docker container inspect c2
                -> 172.17.0.3
            -> docker container exec -it c1 bash
            -> apt update -y && apt install curl -y
            -> curl 172.17.0.3 

        -> Bridge network supports network forwarding i.e port forwarding 

        -> Above activity makes a port(EXPOSED PORT) inside a container 
            accessible to ports on the Docker host for external access. 
            Port mapping is accomplished by binding a port on the host 
            to a port in the container, effectively forwarding traffic 
            from the host to the container. 
            This is a necessary step for any service running 
            inside a container that needs to be accessible from 
            external machines or networks.

        -> -p : docker user defined ports ( custom range 8080 to 9090 )

            -> docker container run -dt --name app1 -p 8080:80 nginx

            -> docker container run -dt --name app2 -p 8085:80 nginx

            -> docker container run -dt --name app3 -p 9090:80 nginx
        
            -> docker container ls -a

        -> -P : docker ephemeral ports ( predefined range 32768 to 61000 )

            -> docker container run -dt --name app4 -P nginx
            -> docker container run -dt --name app5 -P nginx


        -> Custom network for isolation 

            -> docker network ls
            -> docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 10.0.0.0/16 --ip-range 10.0.1.0/24 --gateway 10.0.0.1 cbn 
            -> docker network ls

            -> docker container run -dt --name cbn-1 --network=cbn ubuntu

            -> docker container ls -a

            -> docker container inspect cbn-1
                -> 10.0.1.0
            -> docker container exec -it c1 bash
            -> curl 10.0.1.0 

8th & 9th Dec 2025
==================

    -> By default containers are non-persistent in nature

    -> Docker volumes is a mechanism for persisting data generated by Docker containers.

        -> docker container run -dt --name container-name -v imp_data_vol:/path/in/container my_image

        -> docker container run -dt --name c1 -v imp_data_vol:/imp_data ubuntu:22.04

            -> Update data from container to Host 

            -> This Approach is called as Named Volumes 

        -> docker container run -dt --name c1 -v ~/imp_data:/imp_data ubuntu:22.04 

            -> Update data from Host to Container 

            -> This Approach is called as Host Volumes 


        -> Docker Named Volumes With Application

            -> docker container run -dt --name c1 -v web-app:/var/www/html -p 8080:80 nginx

            -> docker container ls -a

            -> NOTE: When Browsed with port, application is not working 

                -> When working with containers nginx document root is /usr/share/nginx/html

            -> git clone -b dev https://github.com/ravi2krishna/devops-2pm.git /usr/share/nginx/html

            -> rm -r /usr/share/nginx/html

            -> git clone -b dev https://github.com/ravi2krishna/devops-2pm.git /usr/share/nginx/html

            -> exit

            -> docker container ls -a

            -> docker container rm -f c1     

            -> docker container run -dt --name c1 -v web-app:/var/www/html -p 8080:80 nginx  

            -> docker container run -dt --name c2 -v web-app:/usr/share/nginx/html -p 8081:80 nginx  

            -> NOTE: Assume now application is active development mode 

                -> Updated index page 

                -> do git pull ?? 

                -> docker container exec -it c2 bash

                -> cd /usr/share/nginx/html

                -> git pull 

                -> git: command not found

            -> Now lets try from Host 

                -> docker volume inspect web-app

                -> cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/web-app/_data 

                -> sudo cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/web-app/_data

            -> NOTE: Above approach causes issues with permissions, thats when we use Host Volumes 

            -> Host Volume Based Approach 

                -> git clone -b dev https://github.com/ravi2krishna/devops-2pm.git 

                -> ls

                    -> cd devops-2pm
                    -> git pull 

        -> All the docker volumes data is present on Host Disk, which is part of a data center 

        -> When Data center is down, our app data is down 

        -> stateless & stateful 

            -> stateless: data is not mandatory, api's, web services, websites, web apps  

            -> stateful: data is mandatory, database oriented applications 
            

    -> Dockerize / Build Docker Custom Images   

        -> Dockerizing an application is the process of converting an application 
            to run within a Docker container without dependency. 

        -> Custom Docker images allow you to tailor the software environment 
        to meet the specific requirements of your application. 
        You can install additional dependencies, configure settings, 
        and optimise the image for your use case.

        -> Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a "Dockerfile"

        -> A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands 
            a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

        -> overall flow

            -> You create a Dockerfile with the required instructions in your project i.e repository 

            -> Then you will use the "docker build" command to create a Docker image 
                based on the Dockerfile that you created

            -> Then you can run the container using the image built

        -> Docker Instructions / Directives 

            FROM — set base image
            COPY — copy files to image
            RUN — execute command in container
            WORKDIR — set working directory
            VOLUME — create mount-point for a volume
            CMD — set executable for container
            EXPOSE — set port number 
            ENV — set environment variable

    -> Prepare Custom Docker Image to run devops-2pm application

        -> Create Account In Docker Hub 

        -> git clone -b dev https://github.com/ravi2krishna/devops-2pm.git 

        -> cd devops-2pm 

            -> docker build -t ravi2krishna/devops-2pm .

            -> touch Dockerfile 

                -> the Dockerfile cannot be empty
            
            -> What Instructions ??

                -> Use Docker Directives

    -> Next Goal is Dockerize Three Tier Application

        -> React + Nodejs + Postgres

                -> Defines the main executable or command

            -> CMD 

                -> Provides default arguments to the ENTRYPOINT instruction or, 
                    if no ENTRYPOINT is defined, serves as the default command to execute. 

                -> Easy to override

                -> NOTE: Best used when you want the container to behave with variable executable
